Coursera-Computing-for-Data-Analysis
====================================

Programming Assignments of Coursera.com online course: Computing for Data Analysis.

This is a four-week course. Jan 2nd - Jan 30th, 2013.

A new similar course is offered on Cousera: R Programming.  
I am also taking it and I'll try to come up with some different solutions to those problems.
